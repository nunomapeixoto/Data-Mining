Title: Accurate Numerical Derivatives
Description: This package provide methods for calculating (usually)
    accurate numerical first and second order derivatives. Accurate
    calculations are done using Richardson's extrapolation or, when
    applicable, a complex step derivative is available. A simple
    difference method is also provided. Simple difference is (usually)
    less accurate but is much quicker than Richardson's extrapolation
    and provides a useful cross-check.  Methods are provided for real
    scalar and vector valued functions.
