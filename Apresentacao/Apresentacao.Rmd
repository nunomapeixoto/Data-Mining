# Introduction

# Exploratory analysis of the data

- Main Variables
- Target Variable

## Main Variables 

In order to know and summary only the variables that have more impact in the target value we can calculate
the gain ratio between each variable with the TotalBurntArea.

## Target Variable

# Data Pre-Processing

- Remove None importance Variables 
- Normalizing Value

## Remove None importance Variables

## Normalizing Value

# Predictive Models

In order to find the best regression model that can predict the target variable of the test data set with less error, we analysed the following forecasting models:

- Multiple Linear Regression
- Regression Trees
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs)
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
- Random Forest (Ensembles)

# Conclusion
